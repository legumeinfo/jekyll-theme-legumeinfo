    about: "Chickpea (<i>Cicer arietinum</i>) is in the group of cool-season legumes, along with lentil, pea, faba bean and clovers.  Chickpea is one of the earliest cultivated legumes: 7,500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East.  Other common names for the species include garbanzo bean, ceci bean, sanagalu, chana and Bengal gram. There to are two main types of cultivated chickpeas based on seed morphology, desi and kabuli. The desi type of chickpea consists of seeds with a yellow interior but have a thick, wrinkled and dark seed coat, the seeds are approximately 6 to 7 mm in size. The majority of desi chickpeas are split in half to make Chana Dahl. Whereas, the kabuli type of chickpea are lighter in color, have a smooth seed coat and about 8 to 9 mm in size.
