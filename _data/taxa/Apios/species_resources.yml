    about: "This legume species produces starchy, high-protein tubers that were used by indigenous Native Americans.  <i>Apios americana</i> is found throughout eastern and central North America, from Louisiana in the south to Quebec in the north.  A breeding program was begun in the 1980s by Dr. Bill Blackmon and Berthal Reynolds with the goal of creating a more marketable domesticated tuber."
