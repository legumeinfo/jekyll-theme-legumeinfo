    about: "Red clover (<i>Trifolium pratense</i>) is a perennial legume species native to Northwest Africa, Europe and Western Asia.  Today, red clover is found in many regions around the world including the Americas and Australia.  Unlike other legume species, red clover is an outcrossing species due to a strong gametophytic incompatibility system.  Red clover is a widely grown fodder legume crop and is valued for its role in increasing soil fertility by nitrogen fixation."
